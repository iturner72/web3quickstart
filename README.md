## Web 3 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
* Computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone.
* Pen and Paper.
* $10-$20 for registering the ENS name.
* Photo ID, and bank account info.

### Step One: Generate Private Key
* The coolest thing about a private key is the astronomically small chance that
    you will generate the same one as someone else.
* Think of 12 words and write them down on a piece of paper. It is probably best
    if the 12 words are disjoint and do not form a sentence or song.

### Step Two: Create Hot-Wallet
* This private key that we just geneated will now be used to create a
    hot-wallet.
* I like to use Coinbase Wallet, which is a self-custody wallet. This allows you
    to use the Coinbase Wallet plugin in Google Chrome for example. Metamask is
    another popular option.
* Download the Coinbase Wallet App from the AppStore or wherever you get your
    apps. I have both the iOS App on my phone, as well as the browser plugins on
    any web browser that I decide to use.
* You can import the 12 word phrase that you just created, or you can have the
    App generate a phrase for you. Either way, you should not share this phrase
    with anyone.

### Step Three: Buy some ETH
* Now we need to buy some Ether. I use the Coinbase App for this. Since Coinbase
    complies with KYC and AML regulations, you need to upload a photo ID.
* Once your account is verified, it is time to link your bank account and
    purchase around $20 (with current gas fees) of ETH.
* Since you purchased this ETH through a centralized custodial wallet, you will
    now need to send it to the self-custodial wallet we created in steps 1 and
    2.
* From the Coinbase App, head to your assets and click on Ethereum. Find the
    send button, and enter the hot-wallet address, or scan the QR code (the
    chrome plugin can show this with the "receive" button).
* Once you send the transaction you will experience the strange probabilistic
    nature of a blockchain transaction. Since a block is not slated to be mined
    at any particular time, and is a function of network congestion, hash power,
    and other factors; this leaves random times that average to about 10 min on
    BTC, and *not sure* on ETH network. It can be strange the first time you see
    your transaction seemingly frozen in cyberspace.
* When the transaction is confirmed, you can now head to https://ens.domains/
* Once here click on the "Go to app" button in the top right of the screen.
* Now you can search for an ENS name. In this example I will be registering the
    name fbeltran.eth.
* If the name is available, we can continue as shown in the gifs below.
